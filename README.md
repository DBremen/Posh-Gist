Share your PowerShell scripts easily with [GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com/) and Send-Gist.

After doing an `Import-Module PoshGist` ***Ctrl+Shift+S*** is wired up in PowerShell ISE. Load up a script or write one from scratch, press the shortcut keys and you've created a gist.
**NOTE.** If a selection is made, only the selection will be used for the new gist.
